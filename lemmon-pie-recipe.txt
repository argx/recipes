Ingredients:
 - 1 cup white sugar
 - 2 tablespoons butter
 - 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
 - 4 egg yolks, beaten
 - 4 egg whites
 - 3 tablespoons cornstarch
 - 1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - 1 1/2 cups water
 - 2 lemons, juiced and zested
 - 6 tablespoons white sugar

Directions:
 1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

 2. To Make Lemon Filling: In a medium saucepan, whisk together 1 cup sugar,
    flour, cornstarch, and salt. Stir in water, lemon juice and lemon zest. Cook
    over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until mixture comes to a boil.
    Stir in butter. Place egg yolks in a small bowl and gradually whisk in 
    1/2 cup of hot sugar mixture. Whisk egg yolk mixture back into remaining 
    sugar mixture. Bring to a boil and continue to cook while stirring 
    constantly until thick. Remove from heat. Pour filling into baked pastry 
    shell.

 3. To Make Meringue: In a large glass or metal bowl, whip egg whites until
    foamy. Add sugar gradually, and continue to whip until stiff peaks form.
    Spread meringue over pie, sealing the edges at the crust.

 4. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, or until meringue is golden brown.
